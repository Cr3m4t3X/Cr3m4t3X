I'm NOT making ts fancy so if you are here to learn abt me, then here's the holy YAP! I'm Touya, or literally whatever you know me by, or whatever skin I'm sitting as. Typically, I AFK as Sam from SDV or a random character. I am 14, I turn 15 in 13 days (when I'm making this,,,,)!! I go by he/him pronouns, and I'm gay MLM! I typically sit by the ghost BC area, docks, or somewhere near spawn! Or I tend to wander with friends. I am a very nice person, I promise! Feel free to interact! I'm only rude if that's the way I'm being treated OR you are weird asf.... I'm VERY extroverted and I love talking to people! But I do tend to sit alone.... But that does NOT mean I'm okay with c+h. Please ask before c+h ing, it makes me a bit uncomfortable! Unless you are a friend, then feel free, idm. If you are trying to interact with me and I'm not replying or am in menu, I'm probably offtab! Send me a whisper and I'll probably reply! For people who are in VC with me, maybe for regi work or smth, I am LOUD. I am a generally loud person, and I cannot help that. If you don't like it, then leave or mute me. There's a mute button for a REASON, so don't make everyone feel bad just bc everything's loud, you can turn ur volume down or mute me. I also vocal stim! I don't mean to, just something I do! Just because I get into drama does NOT make me a bad person! I tend to fight with people because I am big on getting my point across. I also get fired up easily! I am a VERY bold and blunt person. Basically saying, if I don't like you, you are going to know that I don't like you. I will not tolerate being around or talking to you if i don't like you. I have stong opinions on things and perspectives! If you don't like them, hide me or block me. It's as simple as that. If you physically are incapable of doing so, then maybe you shouldn't be on the game. I block and hide FREELY. I do have a dni and it's on my strawpage! Please read that before interacting so that you are aware! That's mostly it... If I think of anything else, I'll add it but for now thats it!
